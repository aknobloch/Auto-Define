# Auto-Define
Created : June 2015

This is a program I wrote in my sophomore year. It takes a text file as an input, and attempts to parse the definition of that word from the web. This was pretty useful for my intro-level courses, for the teachers who would make me go through every "keyword" in the back of the chapter and look up it's definition. At first this was only a command line tool, but after learning JavaFX I attempted to add a front end GUI. This created a few issues which I never properly addressed. These are documented in the Issues section of this repository.
